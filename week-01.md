# Notes for the week

* Completed Github skills courses to fill the gaps.  I've had lots of practice with the basic git commands and understand them more than I did a week ago. 
* Ran into issues with networking.  Original setup had a complex network which isolated the VMs from my homelab.  Decided to simplify the setup in order to access the VMs directly from my workstation.
* Spent time getting the VMS adjusted to the new network setup. COnfirmed that I could access them via ssh or rdp.  Windows server required TLS auth to access.
* added a .gitignore . Not quite sure I understand it, but I'm sure that will get better.
* more examples with branches, PRs, merges, conflicts, and deleting old branches.
