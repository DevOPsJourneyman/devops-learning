# Notes for the week

* This was the final set up week to prepare for the roadmap.   Most of the tasks were about cleaning the GitHub repo and verifying the Home Lab status.  
* The homelab was offline for a few weeks, so there was plenty of patching to complete.  I also forgot a couple of passwords with the VMs, so I needed to manually reset those. 
* I also spent time fine tuning the roadmap and understanding the gaps. 
* My python course needed some syncing so I was ready to start that as well. 
* Archived old repos that no longer had a purpose or were related to my current path.
